We are a Centre that brings together experts in behavioural science, clinical medicine and population health.

We collaborate with colleagues throughout the world and have been consistently awarded research funding from nationally competitive funding calls. The Centre has a focus on developing a critical mass of the next generation of leading researchers and on offering opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange.

The team is led by [Professor Amanda Daley](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/ssehs/staff/amanda-daley/), and includes senior academics, research associates, doctorate students and support staff.
